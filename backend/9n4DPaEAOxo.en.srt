when there's a sudden change in the wind

speed above and below the plane this

airplanes fly smoothly when the wind's

speed and direction remain consistent

turbulence to actually cause a plane to

turbulence to actually cause a plane to
 

19
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,790
turbulence to actually cause a plane to
crash it can still be very dangerous for

crash it can still be very dangerous for
 

21
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,760
crash it can still be very dangerous for
people inside the cabin
