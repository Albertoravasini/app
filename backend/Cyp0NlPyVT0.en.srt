if train Wheels were like normal Wheels
 

3
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,230
if train Wheels were like normal Wheels
the wheel would just slip off the track

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:05,240
the wheel would just slip off the track
 

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,150
the wheel would just slip off the track
at every turn instead the Train's wheels

00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
at every turn instead the Train's wheels
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,390
at every turn instead the Train's wheels
are actually shaped like a cone the

are actually shaped like a cone the

are actually shaped like a cone the
wheels tread the flat part makes contact

wheels tread the flat part makes contact
 

11
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,470
wheels tread the flat part makes contact
with the rail and supports the train's

12
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:15,480
with the rail and supports the train's

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,150
with the rail and supports the train's
weight and this conical shape allows the

weight and this conical shape allows the
 

15
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,509
weight and this conical shape allows the
wheels to adjust their position on the

16
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:20,519
wheels to adjust their position on the
 

17
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,630
wheels to adjust their position on the
track when the train moves through a

18
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:22,640
track when the train moves through a
 

19
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,670
track when the train moves through a
curve the wheels shift slightly with one

20
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
curve the wheels shift slightly with one
 

21
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,990
curve the wheels shift slightly with one
side moving up the cone and the other

22
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
side moving up the cone and the other
 

23
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,109
side moving up the cone and the other
side moving down this allows one to move

24
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
side moving down this allows one to move
 

25
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,719
side moving down this allows one to move
faster than the other
