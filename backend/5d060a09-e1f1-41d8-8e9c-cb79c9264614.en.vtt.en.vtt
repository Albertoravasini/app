1,399 the Mambo touch It has two possibilities
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.130 align:start position:0%
1,399 the Mambo touch It has two possibilities
with <00:03:11.691><c>A </c><00:03:12.342><c>jug </c><00:03:12.993><c>costs </c><00:03:13.644><c>349 </c><00:03:14.295><c>with </c><00:03:14.946><c>two </c><00:03:15.597><c>jugs</c>

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
with A jug costs 349 with two jugs
 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.030 align:start position:0%
with A jug costs 349 with two jugs
so <00:03:16.559><c>the </c><00:03:16.978><c>non-stick </c><00:03:17.397><c>one </c><00:03:17.816><c>also </c><00:03:18.235><c>costs</c>

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the non-stick one also costs
 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.890 align:start position:0%

399 the closed Messiah Smart costs
499 <00:03:24.325><c>So </c><00:03:24.750><c>we </c><00:03:25.175><c>have </c><00:03:25.600><c>three </c><00:03:26.025><c>different </c><00:03:26.450><c>price </c><00:03:26.875><c>ranges </c><00:03:27.300><c>already</c>

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.930 align:start position:0%
