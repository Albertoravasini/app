with the quartz agglomerate in fact you can

with the quartz agglomerate in fact you can

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 align:start position:0%
also see some small marks but
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
also see some small marks but
they <00:05:27.705><c>disappear </c><00:05:27.950><c>precisely </c><00:05:28.195><c>because </c><00:05:28.440><c>they </c><00:05:28.685><c>are </c><00:05:28.930><c>not</c>

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.379 align:start position:0%
 
now <00:05:32.654><c>let's </c><00:05:32.838><c>go </c><00:05:33.022><c>and </c><00:05:33.206><c>get  </c><00:05:33.390><c>the </c><00:05:33.574><c>screwdriver </c><00:05:33.758><c>and</c>

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 align:start position:0%
now let's go and get  the screwdriver and
 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.990 align:start position:0%
now let's go and get  the screwdriver and
let's <00:05:34.749><c>see </c><00:05:35.109><c>what </c><00:05:35.469><c>happens </c><00:05:35.829><c>leaving </c><00:05:36.189><c>it </c><00:05:36.549><c>more </c><00:05:36.909><c>or</c>

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
let's see what happens leaving it more or
 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
let's see what happens leaving it more or

less from this distance this is a little

less from this distance this is a little

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 align:start position:0%
more realistic because I could have applied
 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.610 align:start position:0%
more realistic because I could have applied

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 align:start position:0%
different pressures with the knife I
 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.379 align:start position:0%
different pressures with the knife I
leave <00:05:44.826><c>this </c><00:05:45.032><c>at </c><00:05:45.238><c>the </c><00:05:45.444><c>same </c><00:05:45.650><c>height </c><00:05:45.856><c>so </c><00:05:46.062><c>it </c><00:05:46.268><c>doesn't</c>

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 align:start position:0%
leave this at the same height so it doesn't
 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
leave this at the same height so it doesn't
run away let's

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 align:start position:0%
run away let's
 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%

here I don't know if you can see it but a  a small hole was
 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.930 align:start position:0%
here I don't know if you can see it but a  a small hole was

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
resist the screwdriver test
 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.710 align:start position:0%
resist the screwdriver test
let's <00:06:04.849><c>try </c><00:06:05.228><c>with </c><00:06:05.607><c>the </c><00:06:05.986><c>aca </c><00:06:06.365><c>pl </c><00:06:06.744><c>which </c><00:06:07.123><c>has </c><00:06:07.502><c>the</c>

let's try with the aca pl which has the
 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.340 align:start position:0%
let's try with the aca pl which has the
same <00:06:08.364><c>finish </c><00:06:09.008><c>so</c>

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 align:start position:0%
same finish so
 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.409 align:start position:0%
same finish so
the <00:06:10.821><c>lamination </c><00:06:11.292><c>is </c><00:06:11.763><c>the </c><00:06:12.234><c>same </c><00:06:12.705><c>but </c><00:06:13.176><c>the</c>

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 align:start position:0%
the lamination is the same but the
 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.390 align:start position:0%
the lamination is the same but the
material <00:06:13.839><c>inside </c><00:06:14.259><c>is </c><00:06:14.679><c>much </c><00:06:15.099><c>harder</c>

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
material inside is much harder
 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.510 align:start position:0%
material inside is much harder
so <00:06:15.640><c>it </c><00:06:15.880><c>could </c><00:06:16.120><c>resist </c><00:06:16.360><c>better </c><00:06:16.600><c>in</c>

now let's look at c at the
 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.300 align:start position:0%
now let's look at c at the

end of the video the last thing I want to
 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
end of the video the last thing I want to
tell <00:07:23.610><c>you </c><00:07:23.910><c>about </c><00:07:24.210><c>worktops</c>

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 align:start position:0%
tell you about worktops
 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.350 align:start position:0%
tell you about worktops
in  <00:07:25.177><c>in </c><00:07:25.424><c>reality </c><00:07:25.671><c>it </c><00:07:25.918><c>concerns </c><00:07:26.165><c>the </c><00:07:26.412><c>backrest </c><00:07:26.659><c>and </c><00:07:26.906><c>therefore</c>

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
in  in reality it concerns the backrest and therefore
 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
in  in reality it concerns the backrest and therefore
the <00:07:27.764><c>part </c><00:07:28.168><c>behind </c><00:07:28.572><c>the </c><00:07:28.976><c>worktop</c>

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 align:start position:0%
the part behind the worktop
 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.490 align:start position:0%
the part behind the worktop
which <00:07:29.574><c>can </c><00:07:29.778><c>be </c><00:07:29.982><c>a </c><00:07:30.186><c>simple </c><00:07:30.390><c>backsplash </c><00:07:30.594><c>and</c>

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
which can be a simple backsplash and
 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.409 align:start position:0%
which can be a simple backsplash and
therefore <00:07:32.050><c>low </c><00:07:32.600><c>or </c><00:07:33.150><c>a</c>

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%
therefore low or a
 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.969 align:start position:0%
therefore low or a
complete <00:07:33.674><c>backrest </c><00:07:33.929><c>reaching </c><00:07:34.184><c>even </c><00:07:34.439><c>up </c><00:07:34.694><c>to </c><00:07:34.949><c>the</c>

strongly advise you against making the

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.050 align:start position:0%
rear panel in laminate or hpl because
 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.950 align:start position:0%
rear panel in laminate or hpl because

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
they are two materials which, although resistant

they are two materials which, although resistant

to many things, are certainly not

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
flame resistant so there is always
 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.760 align:start position:0%

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.770 align:start position:0%
catch fire, but it becomes
 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.860 align:start position:0%
catch fire, but it becomes

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:06.870 align:start position:0%
ugly anyway because it would wear out all
 

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.629 align:start position:0%
ugly anyway because it would wear out all

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.580 align:start position:0%

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:10.590 align:start position:0%
it would become black, in short, it's not nice to

it would become black, in short, it's not nice to
