ok <00:05:02.925><c>so </c><00:05:03.250><c>the </c><00:05:03.575><c>concept </c><00:05:03.900><c>is </c><00:05:04.225><c>just </c><00:05:04.550><c>how</c>

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
ok so the concept is just how
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.730 align:start position:0%
ok so the concept is just how

this <00:05:07.010><c>on </c><00:05:07.280><c>a </c><00:05:07.550><c>practical </c><00:05:07.820><c>level </c><00:05:08.090><c>then</c>

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 align:start position:0%
this on a practical level then
 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.780 align:start position:0%
this on a practical level then
naturally <00:05:09.240><c>what </c><00:05:09.850><c>then </c><00:05:10.460><c>varies</c>

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 align:start position:0%
naturally what then varies
 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
naturally what then varies
is <00:05:11.085><c>that </c><00:05:11.380><c>one </c><00:05:11.675><c>is </c><00:05:11.970><c>damask </c><00:05:12.265><c>the </c><00:05:12.560><c>other </c><00:05:12.855><c>is</c>

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 align:start position:0%
is that one is damask the other is
 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
is that one is damask the other is

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 align:start position:0%
damask the handle can be nicer and more
 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.990 align:start position:0%
damask the handle can be nicer and more

therefore have an impact on

sharp knife it is much more difficult to cut
