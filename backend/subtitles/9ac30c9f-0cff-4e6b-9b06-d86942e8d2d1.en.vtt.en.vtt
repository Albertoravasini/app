let's say that from this point of view this
 

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:07.419 align:start position:0%
let's say that from this point of view this
type <00:08:05.920><c>of </c><00:08:06.151><c>meeting </c><00:08:06.382><c>with </c><00:08:06.613><c>the </c><00:08:06.844><c>customer </c><00:08:07.075><c>was </c><00:08:07.306><c>not</c>

type of meeting with the customer was not
 

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
type of meeting with the customer was not

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:09.889 align:start position:0%
one of the nicest from
 

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.409 align:start position:0%
one of the nicest from
my <00:08:10.109><c>point </c><00:08:10.329><c>of </c><00:08:10.549><c>view </c><00:08:10.769><c>then </c><00:08:10.989><c>we </c><00:08:11.209><c>had</c>

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:11.419 align:start position:0%
my point of view then we had
 

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:12.549 align:start position:0%
my point of view then we had
the <00:08:11.593><c>problem </c><00:08:11.767><c>of </c><00:08:11.941><c>the </c><00:08:12.115><c>power </c><00:08:12.289><c>sockets</c>

00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
the problem of the power sockets
 

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:15.969 align:start position:0%
the problem of the power sockets
underneath <00:08:12.949><c>there </c><00:08:13.339><c>is </c><00:08:13.729><c>that </c><00:08:14.119><c>ok </c><00:08:14.509><c>very </c><00:08:14.899><c>LED </c><00:08:15.289><c>light</c>

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:15.979 align:start position:0%
underneath there is that ok very LED light
 

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:18.489 align:start position:0%
underneath there is that ok very LED light
nice <00:08:16.291><c>that </c><00:08:16.603><c>I </c><00:08:16.915><c>had </c><00:08:17.227><c>them </c><00:08:17.539><c>put </c><00:08:17.851><c>the </c><00:08:18.163><c>problem</c>

00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:18.499 align:start position:0%
nice that I had them put the problem
 

00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:19.659 align:start position:0%
nice that I had them put the problem
lies <00:08:18.674><c>in </c><00:08:18.849><c>the </c><00:08:19.024><c>fact </c><00:08:19.199><c>that </c><00:08:19.374><c>when </c><00:08:19.549><c>they</c>

00:08:19.659 --> 00:08:19.669 align:start position:0%
lies in the fact that when they
 

00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
lies in the fact that when they
sent <00:08:19.896><c>me </c><00:08:20.123><c>the </c><00:08:20.350><c>diagram </c><00:08:20.577><c>of </c><00:08:20.804><c>their </c><00:08:21.031><c>lights </c><00:08:21.258><c>and</c>

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:21.289 align:start position:0%
sent me the diagram of their lights and
 

00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:23.139 align:start position:0%
sent me the diagram of their lights and
therefore <00:08:21.544><c>all </c><00:08:21.799><c>the </c><00:08:22.054><c>systems </c><00:08:22.309><c>where </c><00:08:22.564><c>to </c><00:08:22.819><c>put</c>

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:23.149 align:start position:0%
therefore all the systems where to put
 

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
therefore all the systems where to put
the <00:08:23.364><c>power </c><00:08:23.579><c>socket </c><00:08:23.794><c>in </c><00:08:24.009><c>short </c><00:08:24.224><c>where </c><00:08:24.439><c>to</c>

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:24.649 align:start position:0%
the power socket in short where to
 

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
the power socket in short where to

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:26.329 align:start position:0%
get where to put the switches
 

00:08:26.329 --> 00:08:28.569 align:start position:0%
get where to put the switches
they <00:08:26.679><c>are </c><00:08:27.029><c>obviously </c><00:08:27.379><c>all </c><00:08:27.729><c>the </c><00:08:28.079><c>things </c><00:08:28.429><c>they</c>

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:28.579 align:start position:0%
they are obviously all the things they
 

00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:30.219 align:start position:0%
they are obviously all the things they

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:31.579 align:start position:0%
LED light which naturally I had
 

00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:33.249 align:start position:0%
LED light which naturally I had
also <00:08:31.774><c>chosen </c><00:08:31.969><c>but </c><00:08:32.164><c>three </c><00:08:32.359><c>months </c><00:08:32.554><c>have </c><00:08:32.749><c>passed </c><00:08:32.944><c>since </c><00:08:33.139><c>I</c>

00:08:33.249 --> 00:08:33.259 align:start position:0%
also chosen but three months have passed since I
 

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
also chosen but three months have passed since I
ordered <00:08:33.541><c>the </c><00:08:33.823><c>kitchen </c><00:08:34.105><c>maybe </c><00:08:34.387><c>you </c><00:08:34.669><c>forget</c>

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:35.329 align:start position:0%
ordered the kitchen maybe you forget
 

00:08:35.329 --> 00:08:37.629 align:start position:0%
ordered the kitchen maybe you forget
that <00:08:35.620><c>you </c><00:08:35.911><c>put </c><00:08:36.202><c>a </c><00:08:36.493><c>light </c><00:08:36.784><c>there </c><00:08:37.075><c>and </c><00:08:37.366><c>so</c>

00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:37.639 align:start position:0%
that you put a light there and so
 

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.249 align:start position:0%
that you put a light there and so
here <00:08:37.879><c>I </c><00:08:38.119><c>only </c><00:08:38.359><c>have </c><00:08:38.599><c>two </c><00:08:38.839><c>switches</c>

00:08:39.249 --> 00:08:39.259 align:start position:0%
here I only have two switches
 

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:42.509 align:start position:0%
here I only have two switches
controlled <00:08:39.689><c>for </c><00:08:40.119><c>my </c><00:08:40.549><c>lights</c>

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
controlled for my lights
 

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:44.650 align:start position:0%
controlled for my lights
which <00:08:42.941><c>are </c><00:08:43.363><c>two </c><00:08:43.785><c>that </c><00:08:44.207><c>I </c><00:08:44.629><c>use</c>

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:44.660 align:start position:0%
which are two that I use
 

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.900 align:start position:0%
which are two that I use
so <00:08:44.881><c>to </c><00:08:45.102><c>record </c><00:08:45.323><c>one </c><00:08:45.544><c>wing </c><00:08:45.765><c>and </c><00:08:45.986><c>the </c><00:08:46.207><c>other </c><00:08:46.428><c>one </c><00:08:46.649><c>there </c><00:08:46.870><c>it's</c>

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:46.910 align:start position:0%
so to record one wing and the other one there it's
 

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.689 align:start position:0%
so to record one wing and the other one there it's
plus <00:08:47.222><c>the </c><00:08:47.534><c>third </c><00:08:47.846><c>one </c><00:08:48.158><c>that </c><00:08:48.470><c>placed </c><00:08:48.782><c>them </c><00:08:49.094><c>but</c>

00:08:49.689 --> 00:08:49.699 align:start position:0%
plus the third one that placed them but
 

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:50.740 align:start position:0%
plus the third one that placed them but
practically <00:08:49.916><c>I'm </c><00:08:50.133><c>missing </c><00:08:50.350><c>the </c><00:08:50.567><c>third</c>

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:50.750 align:start position:0%
practically I'm missing the third
 

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.879 align:start position:0%
practically I'm missing the third
switch <00:08:51.194><c>and </c><00:08:51.638><c>the </c><00:08:52.082><c>third </c><00:08:52.526><c>socket</c>

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:52.889 align:start position:0%
switch and the third socket
 

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:54.139 align:start position:0%
switch and the third socket
so <00:08:53.159><c>maybe </c><00:08:53.429><c>they </c><00:08:53.699><c>aren't</c>

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:54.149 align:start position:0%
so maybe they aren't
 

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:56.509 align:start position:0%
so maybe they aren't

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
problem is that if I pay you for the assembly the
 

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.310 align:start position:0%
problem is that if I pay you for the assembly the
names <00:10:49.785><c>you </c><00:10:50.050><c>finish </c><00:10:50.315><c>assembling </c><00:10:50.580><c>the </c><00:10:50.845><c>dishwasher  </c><00:10:51.110><c>and</c>

names you finish assembling the dishwasher  and
so <00:10:51.575><c>it </c><00:10:51.830><c>didn't </c><00:10:52.085><c>connect </c><00:10:52.340><c>to </c><00:10:52.595><c>me, </c><00:10:52.850><c>the</c>

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970 align:start position:0%
so it didn't connect to me, the
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.430 align:start position:0%
so it didn't connect to me, the

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
power socket was missing and the
 

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.630 align:start position:0%
power socket was missing and the

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
power socket I had to make had to be
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
power socket I had to make had to be
cut <00:10:55.982><c>off </c><00:10:56.324><c>the </c><00:10:56.666><c>original </c><00:10:57.008><c>cable </c><00:10:57.350><c>to</c>

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
cut off the original cable to
 

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
cut off the original cable to
go <00:10:57.932><c>to </c><00:10:58.184><c>the </c><00:10:58.436><c>back </c><00:10:58.688><c>row </c><00:10:58.940><c>in </c><00:10:59.192><c>another </c><00:10:59.444><c>place</c>

00:10:59.920 --> 00:10:59.930 align:start position:0%
go to the back row in another place
 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.250 align:start position:0%
go to the back row in another place
so <00:11:00.362><c>this </c><00:11:00.794><c>is </c><00:11:01.226><c>a </c><00:11:01.658><c>bit </c><00:11:02.090><c>bad </c><00:11:02.522><c>also </c><00:11:02.954><c>because</c>

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:03.260 align:start position:0%
so this is a bit bad also because
 

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.230 align:start position:0%
so this is a bit bad also because
I <00:11:03.632><c>paid </c><00:11:04.004><c>for </c><00:11:04.376><c>it </c><00:11:04.748><c>precisely  </c><00:11:05.120><c>the</c>

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
I paid for it precisely  the
