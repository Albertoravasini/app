I <00:26:06.940><c>have </c><00:26:07.280><c>arranged </c><00:26:07.620><c>all </c><00:26:07.960><c>the </c><00:26:08.300><c>bottles </c><00:26:08.640><c>that</c>

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
I have arranged all the bottles that
 

00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:12.350 align:start position:0%
I have arranged all the bottles that
carafe <00:26:09.449><c>that </c><00:26:09.719><c>I </c><00:26:09.989><c>always </c><00:26:10.259><c>use </c><00:26:10.529><c>in </c><00:26:10.799><c>the </c><00:26:11.069><c>summer </c><00:26:11.339><c>then </c><00:26:11.609><c>I </c><00:26:11.879><c>will</c>

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
carafe that I always use in the summer then I will
 

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.049 align:start position:0%

instead <00:26:12.828><c>show </c><00:26:13.296><c>you </c><00:26:13.764><c>the </c><00:26:14.232><c>lower </c><00:26:14.700><c>part</c>

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
instead show you the lower part
 

00:26:15.059 --> 00:26:19.669 align:start position:0%
instead show you the lower part
So <00:26:15.662><c>here </c><00:26:16.265><c>in </c><00:26:16.868><c>this </c><00:26:17.471><c>door </c><00:26:18.074><c>I </c><00:26:18.677><c>have</c>

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
So here in this door I have
 

00:26:19.679 --> 00:26:22.970 align:start position:0%
So here in this door I have
arranged <00:26:20.255><c>the </c><00:26:20.831><c>detergents </c><00:26:21.407><c>therefore </c><00:26:21.983><c>the </c><00:26:22.559><c>detergents</c>

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
arranged the detergents therefore the detergents
 

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.950 align:start position:0%
arranged the detergents therefore the detergents
that <00:26:23.185><c>I </c><00:26:23.390><c>need </c><00:26:23.595><c>here </c><00:26:23.800><c>in </c><00:26:24.005><c>the </c><00:26:24.210><c>kitchen </c><00:26:24.415><c>anyway</c>

the detergents then in the  next door
 

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.210 align:start position:0%
the detergents then in the  next door
we have

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:55.220 align:start position:0%
we have
 

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.250 align:start position:0%
we have

So the undifferentiated here in this
 

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.250 align:start position:0%
So the undifferentiated here in this
white <00:26:58.513><c>there </c><00:26:58.766><c>is </c><00:26:59.019><c>the </c><00:26:59.272><c>undifferentiated </c><00:26:59.525><c>and </c><00:26:59.778><c>on </c><00:27:00.031><c>this </c><00:27:00.284><c>side </c><00:27:00.537><c>and</c>

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
white there is the undifferentiated and on this side and
 

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.010 align:start position:0%
white there is the undifferentiated and on this side and
there <00:27:01.518><c>is </c><00:27:01.776><c>the </c><00:27:02.034><c>wet </c><00:27:02.292><c>for </c><00:27:02.550><c>now </c><00:27:02.808><c>I </c><00:27:03.066><c>have </c><00:27:03.324><c>arranged </c><00:27:03.582><c>like </c><00:27:03.840><c>this</c>

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
there is the wet for now I have arranged like this
 

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.549 align:start position:0%
there is the wet for now I have arranged like this
then <00:27:04.270><c>if </c><00:27:04.520><c>by </c><00:27:04.770><c>chance </c><00:27:05.020><c>I </c><00:27:05.270><c>need </c><00:27:05.520><c>perhaps</c>
