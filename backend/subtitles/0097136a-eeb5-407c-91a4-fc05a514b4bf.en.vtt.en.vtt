00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
this way the edge remains
 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.469 align:start position:0%
this way the edge remains
Ok <00:07:00.662><c>now </c><00:07:01.084><c>let's </c><00:07:01.506><c>move </c><00:07:01.928><c>on </c><00:07:02.350><c>to </c><00:07:02.772><c>the </c><00:07:03.194><c>filling</c>
